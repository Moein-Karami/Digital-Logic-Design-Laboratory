## Language: Verilog and System Verilog

## 01_Clock and Periodic Signal Generation
The goal of this project is to introduce the concepts of static characteristics of digital logic
gates, delay times, clock frequency generation and digital system using schematic diagram and
Verilog HDL. This lab is organized in two separate segments. The first segment emphasizes on the
analog implementation of different oscillator circuits using LTspice simulator.In the second part I
have implemented the same circuits in Verilog HDL using Quartus. Finally I have got into FPGA
implementation using Altera-Modelsim simulation tool.

## 02_Clock Adjusting and Monitoring
The goal of this project is to design an adjustable clock source that can fix the output
frequency at a desired value.

## 03_Function Generator
In this project, I have designed an Arbitrary Generator that is capable of generating each
of the sine, square, rhomboid, saw-tooth and any arbitrary waveforms with wide range for frequency selection. 

## 04_Integrated System
In this experiment I have designed a frequency multiplier and used this in combination with an exponential acceletor
